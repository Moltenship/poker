# AGENTS.md

<!-- convex-ai-start -->

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read `convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running `npx convex ai-files install`.

## Task Completion Requirements

- All of `npm run format:check`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run typecheck:tsgo` must pass before considering tasks completed.

## Commit message style

You MUST use conventional commits specification for commit message and body - https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification


## Maintainability

Long term maintainability is a core priority. If you add new functionality, first check if there is shared logic that can be extracted to a separate module. Duplicate logic across multiple files is a code smell and should be avoided. Don't be afraid to change existing code. Don't take shortcuts by just adding local logic to solve a problem.

## Core Priorities

1. Performance first.
2. Reliability first.
3. Keep requests to jira as minimal as possible. Rely on caching and always tell user, that additional jira request is required.
4. Typesafety is a MUST.
5. Code should be readable.
If a tradeoff is required, choose correctness and robustness over short-term convenience.
